# Vision Zero in USA

<img src="pictures/map_accidents.png" width="700">

According to World Health Organization approximately 1.35 million people die each year in car accidents all over the world. There are multiple risk factors that increase the chance of car accident and level of its severity, for instance, speeding, distracted driving, unsafe vehicles, alcohol and so on. Significant part of these factors assume that the whole responsibility for road safety lies with road users and cars manufacturers.

In the 90's Sweden designed and adopted Vision Zero as a long-term strategy to increase road safety and reduce to zero lethal car accidents. The revolutionary idea of Vision Zero is to share responsibility for road safety between people using roads and people designing them. Systematic approach of Vision Zero enables to create a safe mobility system forgiving of human error that guarantees everyone's right to move safely in their communitie. **By now thanks to systematic implementation of Vision Zero principles Sweden possesses the best road safety record in the EU.**
​

**Simply saying, Vision Zero admits that people make mistakes, they are unavoidable and we should design such roads and regulations to ensure that human mistakes on the roads will never result in traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries.**

Vision Zero is more than a program or safety concept. It's an ethical approach that assumes: ["It can never be ethically acceptable that people are killed or seriously injured when moving within the road transport system."](https://www.monash.edu/muarc/archive/our-publications/papers/visionzero) It is not right that traffic deaths are considered to be inevitable side effects of modern world. 

 
Since Sweden became a pioneer, multiple countries and cities across the globe have implemented principles of Vision Zero. Since 2014 several US cities have started adopting Vision Zero, for instance, Boston, Los Angeles, Seattle and couple of states, for instance, Maryland. Also, there are states that plan to adopt Vision Zero and run public campaigns coverig problems of low road safety. 

​

**The goals of this project are following:**

- to analyse car accidents in the USA, particularly in California, to evaluate if there is any progress in the last 5-6 years;

- to analyse cases of fatal car accidents in the cities with changes performed by cities' administrations;

- to create a model that predicts if a car accident results in death or serious injury.
